This project utilizes *PowerBI* for data analysis and visualization.

### Business Problem
The Prevailing Challenge: Hospitality Haven faces the challenge of efficiently managing their hotel bookings, pricing, and occupancy rates. This challenge is further exacerbated by the highly competitive nature of the travel and tourism industry, which is influenced by seasonality, market demand fluctuations, and evolving customer preferences. The specific obstacles the company encounters include:

✓ Seasonal Variations: The hotel chain experiences significant fluctuations in occupancy rates due to seasonal tourism trends. They struggle to predict these patterns accurately, often resulting in either overbooking or underutilization of their properties.
✓ Pricing Dilemma: Setting optimal room prices is a complex task. Hospitality Haven aims to maximize revenue without deterring potential guests by setting prices that are too high. Achieving this balance is a constant challenge.
✓ Customer Behavior Understanding: The company lacks a deep understanding of customer behavior patterns, such as booking lead times, preferred booking channels, and the impact of promotions or discounts on booking decisions.
✓ Demand Forecasting: Predicting future booking demand is crucial for effective resource allocation and staffing. Inaccurate forecasts lead to under- or over-staffing, affecting both guest experience and operational costs.
✓ Competitive Intelligence: Staying competitive requires monitoring and reacting to market dynamics promptly. Hospitality Haven needs insights into competitor pricing strategies and booking trends.

### Objectives
The project aims to achieve the following precise objectives and goals:

✓ Comprehensive Data Insights: Utilize Power BI to gain comprehensive insights into historical booking data, customer behavior patterns, and occupancy rates.
✓ Customer Behavior Analysis: Perform in-depth analysis of customer behavior, including booking lead times, preferred booking channels, and the impact of promotions or discounts on booking decisions.
✓ Booking Pattern Identification: Identify and visualize booking patterns, including seasonality trends, to facilitate proactive decision-making in resource allocation and staffing.
✓ Pricing Strategy Assessment: Analyze historical pricing data to evaluate the effectiveness of past pricing strategies and identify opportunities for optimization.
✓ Competitor Benchmarking: Use Power BI to benchmark competitor pricing strategies, occupancy rates, and booking trends for informed decision-making and competitive positioning.

## Insights
- Haven Hotel enjoys a steady stream of bookings with a diverse clientele.
- **Age range:** The average guest is 44 years old. 
- Double rooms lead with 508 bookings, followed closely by Suite (504), Deluxe (495), and Single (493) rooms.
- Bookings peak in March and May, then decline steadily, reaching a low in September and November.
- **Travel Purpose and Loyalty:** Leisure travel is the most common purpose, with the highest bookings for non-loyalty customers. Business travel has the least bookings but is evenly split between loyalty statuses.
- Nigerians top the list of international guests followed by Egypt, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Morocco.
- Summer is peak season, and there's potential to attract more business travelers and increase Single room bookings.
- The cancellation rate is low (19%), suggesting high customer satisfaction.


## Recommendations
- **Loyalty Programs for Leisure Travelers:** Develop loyalty programs and exclusive benefits for non-loyalty leisure travelers to convert them into loyal customers and encourage repeat bookings.
- **Single Room Promotions:** Since Single room bookings are the lowest, offer special discounts, weekend getaways, or business packages targeting solo travelers. Also collaborate with companies to provide deals for corporate guests.
- **Upgrade Offers:** Encourage guests who book Single or Deluxe rooms to upgrade to Suites with targeted promotions, like "Stay 2 nights, upgrade to a Suite for free."
- **Off-Peak Incentives:** Since bookings drop in September and November, launch promotions during these months such as discounted stays, holiday packages, or events like conferences and retreats to increase bookings.
- **Expand African Market:** Increase visibility in countries like Egypt, Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Morocco with specialized packages, direct marketing, or partnerships with travel agencies. Providing targeted offers or language-specific services for guests from these regions could further boost international bookings.
- **Retention Strategies:** With a low cancellation rate and high customer satisfaction, emphasize retaining customers through loyalty programs, referral discounts, or personalized experiences based on past preferences.
- **Cater to High Satisfaction:** Capitalize on the low cancellation rate by encouraging positive reviews and referrals. Send post-stay surveys or follow-up emails that offer discount codes for future bookings in exchange for reviews.

By leveraging these insights and recommendations, the decision-making capabilities of the hotel booking team can be enhanced, leading to better strategies and increased revenue.
